This blog wil serve the purpose of researching French and Alsatian immigration to the US, from Europe and from Canada. The objective of this blog is to overlaps it with research on Japanese immigration, and the ways the two communities overlaps in cities like California and New York. I will also research True Crime history, and the impact of capital punishment on immigrant communities.
